# RowanDeluca.github.io

1. Shoshanna "Rowan" DeLuca-Frerking
2. Named the account after my chosen name, I only have one repository created right now, and I haven't experimented with github much yet.
3. The repository I made is just named after me and currently has no edits to it.
4. I downloaded the desktop github and then opened and cloned the repository to my computer (specifically a file on my desktop).
